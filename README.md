# MODAF ontological data exchange mechanism

The MODAF ontological data exchange mechanism (MODEM) is an evolution of the M3, based on the ‘international defence enterprise architecture specification’ (IDEAS) foundation model. It contains all the MODAF elements currently in M3, but has been built from first principles to support enterprise architecture whereas M3 was a profile that extended UML.

Like the M3, MODEM is primarily aimed at the developers of software tools to enable them to implement a MODAF compliant profile. However, it is recognised that M3 is also used by architects to help them understand the relationships between the organisations, processes, and systems that they are modelling. MODEM provides both these stakeholder groups with a more logical construct to work against.

MODEM was developed by the Swedish armed forces working with MOD staff, and is seen as a key component contributing to the development of the Unified Architecture Framework (UAF), a proposed convergence of the individual frameworks currently used by Canada, UK, US, and NATO. MODEM will be the last major MODAF deliverable, as the focus will now be on the development of UAF.

MODEM is provided here, to give MODAF stakeholders early visibility of its capability, ahead of the development of a migration plan.
